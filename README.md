This repo's main objective is to hold experimental code &amp; projects by myself &amp; 1 other, yet to join GH (Hurry Up Surush!). Fear does not exist over these ends. [Random] things will be tried &amp; 'failure' will almost certainly, I mean hopefully be experienced. Our goal is to learn, and expand and improve our skills &amp; dev tools spectrum.
